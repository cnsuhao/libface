 * @brief   Test example.
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This is a simple example of the use of the libface library.
 * It implements face detection and recognition and uses the opencv libraries.
 *
 * @note: libface does not require users to have openCV knowledge, so here,
 *        openCV is treated as a "3rd-party" library for image manipulation convenience.

The destructor of a pointer is a no-op. meaning it does not release the object it is pointing to. Now this actually what we want, since we still need the actual object - finalresult is pointing to it. We still need to delete result, because in the next iteration of the for loop, result will be changed to point somewhere else.

    // Now that we are done, we still have finalresult pointing to some Face objects (that is, if we found any in the images). Once main() returns, the destructor for finalresult will be called automatically, which in turn calls the destructors for all the elements of the vector. However, this will only delete the pointers, but not the Face objects pointed to, as already desribed earlier. We need to manually destruct all objects that finalresult points to.
